# 🚀 Marketplace Enhancements Plan

## Three Major Improvements Needed

### 1. ✅ Fix Search Functionality
**Problem:** Search box exists but doesn't filter products
**Solution:** Connect search state to product filtering

### 2. ✅ Amazon-Style Product Detail Page
**Problem:** Clicking product goes directly to Amazon
**Solution:** Show detailed product page first (like Amazon) with:
- Large product images
- Full description
- Customer reviews section
- "Frequently bought together"
- "Customers also viewed"
- Detailed specifications
- "Add to Cart" → Then Amazon

### 3. ✅ Admin Panel for Adding Products
**Problem:** Must edit code to add products
**Solution:** Create admin dashboard with:
- Product list view
- Add new product form
- Edit existing products
- Delete products
- Upload images
- Preview before save
