## 🚀 **How to Add More Products**

### **Method 1: Edit Code (Current)**
1. Open `src/lib/marketplace/productCatalog.ts`
2. Copy existing product template
3. Modify fields (ID, name, price, ASIN, etc.)
4. Save file
5. Product appears automatically!

### **Method 2: Admin Panel (Recommended - To Be Built)**
For easier product management, I recommend building an admin panel next. This would allow:
- Add products via web form
- Edit existing products
- Delete products
- No code editing needed

**Would you like me to build the admin panel?** It would take about 30-45 minutes and make product management much easier.
