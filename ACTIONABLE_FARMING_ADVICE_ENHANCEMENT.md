## Jal Saathi Enhanced Tips

### Soil-Specific Actions

#### Sandy Soil
```
🏖️ Sandy soil detected
ACTION:
- Apply 5-7 cm mulch (straw/dry grass) → 30% less evaporation
- Water every 2 days instead of daily
- Split irrigation: 1 hour twice vs 2 hours once
- Add 2-3 tons compost per acre before next sowing
BENEFIT: Better water retention, save ₹200/week
```

#### Clay Soil
```
🏔️ Clay soil detected
ACTION:
- Water deeply but less frequently (every 4-5 days)
- Avoid daily watering → causes root rot
- Break soil crust after irrigation
- Dig 1-foot pit to check drainage
WARNING: If water stays >6 hours, improve drainage NOW
```

#### Loamy Soil
```
✅ Loamy soil - ideal!
ACTION:
- Maintain current schedule
- Check moisture at 6-inch depth
- Add FYM (5 tons/acre) annually
- Rotate crops for soil health
```

### Crop Stage-Specific Actions

#### Flowering Stage (CRITICAL!)
```
🌸 FLOWERING STAGE - DON'T SKIP IRRIGATION!
IMPACT: 1 day water stress = 15-20% yield loss
ACTION:
- Irrigate every 2-3 days
- Maintain 70-80% soil moisture
- Check daily - if top 2 inches dry, irrigate NOW
- Apply Potash (10kg/acre) + Boron (500g/acre)
- Don't apply nitrogen → causes flower drop
```

#### Fruiting Stage (CRITICAL!)
```
🍅 FRUITING STAGE - MAINTAIN CONSISTENT MOISTURE
IMPACT: Water stress → fruit cracking, reduced size
ACTION:
- Irrigate every 3-4 days
- Don't let soil dry completely
- Apply Calcium Nitrate (5kg/acre) with irrigation
- Prevents blossom end rot in tomatoes, peppers
```

#### Vegetative Stage
```
🌱 Build strong root system
ACTION:
- Water deeply (wet soil to 12 inches)
- Less frequent irrigation
- Slight stress OK → makes roots go deeper
- Don't let plants wilt
```

### Water-Saving Techniques

```
💧 DRIP IRRIGATION:
- Saves 40-50% water vs flood
- Cost: ₹25,000/acre
- Recovers in 2 years
- Government subsidy: 50-80%
- Apply at agriculture department

🚿 SPRINKLER:
- Saves 30-35% water
- Good for vegetables, wheat
- Cost: ₹15,000/acre
- Check for subsidy

🌊 FLOOD IRRIGATION:
- Make small basins
- Water one basin at a time
- Saves 20% water vs flooding entire field
```

### Cost Tracking

```
💰 TRACK YOUR SAVINGS:
- Note diesel/electricity used
- Expected savings: ₹300-500 per week
- If not saving, check for:
  ✓ Leaks in pipes (wastes 1000L/hour = ₹20-30)
  ✓ Over-irrigation (30-40% common)
  ✓ Wrong timing (midday = 50% evaporation)

📊 COMPARE WITH NEIGHBOR:
- They irrigate daily, you follow schedule
- You use 30% less water for same yield
- Savings: ₹1,500-2,000 per month!
```
