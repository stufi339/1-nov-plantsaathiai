## 🎓 Example Conversation

**You:** "Check my field health"

**AI:** "I can see you have 3 fields:

**Rice Field (2.5 hectares)**
- NDVI: 0.65 (Excellent - Dense vegetation) ✅
- NDMI: 0.42 (High moisture) ✅
- Status: Healthy

**Wheat Field (1.8 hectares)**
- NDVI: 0.35 (Moderate - Sparse vegetation) ⚠️
- NDMI: 0.15 (Low moisture - Needs irrigation) ⚠️
- Action: Irrigate within 24 hours

**Vegetable Plot (0.5 hectares)**
- NDVI: 0.58 (Good - Healthy) ✅
- NDMI: 0.38 (Moderate moisture) ✅
- Status: Healthy

**Priority:** Wheat Field needs immediate irrigation!"

---

**You:** "When should I irrigate wheat field?"

**AI:** "Based on your Wheat Field:

**Current Status:**
- NDMI: 0.15 (Low moisture - Urgent!)
- Temperature: 28°C
- Humidity: 55%
- Days since planting: 45 (Tillering stage)

**Irrigation Schedule:**

**TODAY (Urgent):**
- Time: 6-8 PM (avoid evaporation)
- Amount: 2-3 inches of water
- Method: Flood or drip irrigation

**Why Evening?**
- Temperature drops to 22°C
- Less evaporation (save 40% water)
- Better plant absorption

**With Irrigation:**
- Apply Urea: 10kg/acre
- Mix in water for better absorption

**Next Irrigation:** In 7-10 days

Tillering stage needs consistent moisture for good yield!"
