## ℹ️ Informational Warnings (Not Errors)

### 1. Dynamic Import Warnings
```
(!) blackBoxService.ts is dynamically imported but also statically imported
```

**What it means:**
- Some modules are imported both ways (static and dynamic)
- This is intentional for code splitting
- **Not an error** - just informational
- **No action needed**

### 2. Chunk Size Warning
```
(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification
```

**What it means:**
- Main bundle is 1.6 MB (484 KB gzipped)
- This is normal for a feature-rich app
- Gzipped size (484 KB) is what users download
- **Not an error** - just a suggestion
- **No action needed** for now

**Why it's okay:**
- Modern apps often have large bundles
- Gzip compression reduces size by 70%
- Lazy loading is already implemented
- Performance is still good
