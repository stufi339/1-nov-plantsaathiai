## **🎯 The Core Concept**

### **Problem:**
Current farming dashboards show data, not insights. Farmers must interpret complex metrics themselves.

### **Solution:**
BlackBox Command Center correlates multiple data sources to generate actionable insights with financial impact.

### **Example:**
```
❌ Old Way:
"NDVI: 0.55, Humidity: 85%, Temperature: 28°C"

✅ New Way:
"🚨 Disease Risk Alert
Your rice field health dropped 15%. High humidity + warm temperature 
creates fungal disease risk.
💰 Impact: Potential loss of ₹2,500
✅ Action: Spray Mancozeb today before 10 AM
⏰ Time: Next 24 hours | 🎯 85% confidence"
```
